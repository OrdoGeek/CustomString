# CustomString
This project was for testing my programming skills in java, while studying a java object oriented programming course.

# INSTRUCTIONS
In this assignment, you will implement a simple class called ​ CustomString​ . This class represents a more customizable version of a String, with additional attributes and methods.

For example, the CustomString class has a “reverse” method which returns a new string version of the current string where the capitalization is reversed (i.e., lowercase to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase) for the alphabetical characters specified in a given argument. For CustomString “abc, XYZ; 123.”, calling reverse("bcdxyz@3210.") will return "aBC, xyz; 123.".

The CustomString class also has a “remove” method which returns a new string version of the current string where the alphabetical characters specified in a given argument, are removed. For CustomString "my lucky numbers are 6, 8, and 19.", calling remove("ra6") will return "my lucky numbers e 6, 8, nd 19.".
